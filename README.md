# üê≥ Self-Hosted Docker Swarm Stacks

This repository contains a collection of self-hosted custom **Docker Swarm stacks** used in my environment, for deploying and managing various services in a scalable, high-availability fashion across a number of nodes. Each stack includes:


## üìã Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each representing a service. Each service directory contains:
- A Docker Compose file (Swarm-compatible) `docker-stack-compose.yml` file or equivalent.
- Environment variable files (`.env`).
- Bash scripts for building, deploying, and removing the service.
- Additional configuration files as needed (e.g., `config.yml`, `Dockerfile`, etc.).
- Optional build scripts for custom Docker images

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JackieTreeh0rn/Docker-Swarm-Stacks.git
cd Docker-Swarm-Stacks
```


### 2. Deploy | Remove | Build (optional) using the provided scripts for each stack
```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ./remove.sh
   ./build.sh  # (optional, for custom images)
   ```


## üìã Notes

- All stacks are designed for Docker Swarm mode.
- Some services (like Jellyfin, Homebridge) run in host network mode and use external Traefik rules.
- Networks are created per stack (<stack>_backend) for isolation.
- Labels and constraints are used to control placement on Swarm nodes.
- Most stacks use shared storage (glusterfs) for persistent data - switch to your preferred storage solution as needed
- Environment variables are used for configuration and secrets management.
